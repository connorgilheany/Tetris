# Tetris with AI

This is the second version of Tetris with AI that I have made. It utilizes the Slick2D library for user input and drawing to the screen. The game is also playable without AI, if you're into that.

#AI
The AI works by taking the current piece and placing it in all possible rotations and locations. It then analyzes what that placement would do: how many lines would it complete, how high would it be placed, would it leave an overhang, does it further block any open spaces?
